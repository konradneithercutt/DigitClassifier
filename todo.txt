1. Random digits interface
    - Add functionality to the digits_gui.py GUI to actually show the image of a random digit
      by embedding a matplotlib plot in a tkinter window
    - Add an option to only show incorrect digits in the window?
    - Enable classifier.get_random_digit() to return an image from the CV set
2. Paint interface
    - Create a GUI that allows the user to draw a digit 0-9 and receive the mlp's
      prediction on their drawing.
3. Science: Attempting to improve accuracy
    - Apply tests for discovering the algorithms weaknesses. Create a histogram
      of which digits it gets wrong most often.
    - Plot the accuracy of the algorithm on the training and CV sets as a function
      of the number of training examples provided to it to determine if the problem
      is one of bias or variance.
    - Determine the best hyperparameters for accurate performance.
    - Determine final performance on the test set. For integrity (to prevent
      overfitting), this step has to be done AFTER the hyperparameters have been
      tuned on the cross validation set.
4. Documentation, organization
    - The program so far is lacking in comments. It should be my job to get it
      all caught up. - Steve
    - Decide on a commenting style going forward, and the author of a given
      piece of code will be in charge of keeping their work clean. Use whitespace
      and use it uniformly. Every class and function needs a comment describing
      its input, output, and expectations for the state of the data it receives.
      All code whose function is not obvious should have a one-line comment
      to help the reader understand it.
    - Create uniformity in the naming of variables across files (for example,
      known labels are called "label" in some places and "gold label" in other
      places). classifier.show_digit() calls for a "label," but just displays
      as a string whatever is passed. Also, any class attribute (self.variable)
      should not have its name used a second time in a different scope.
    - Delete all the commented-out code that is now obsolete.
5. Performance (speed of classifier.py)
    - Booting is slow, even when loading an already-trained classifier. I think
      pickle was the wrong choice. Find a new, faster way to make the data
      persistent (meaning able to be saved and reloaded).
    - If changing the serialization and save/load of the data leaves the program
      too slow, find more ways to improve performance on the classifier.
6. DIY NN
    - Implement our own feed forward neural network to classify the handwritten
      digits
